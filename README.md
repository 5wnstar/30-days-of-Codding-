We first create a socket object with the AF_INET and SOCK_STREAM parameters 
The AF_INET parameter is saying we are going to use a standard IPv4 address or hostname, and SOCK_STREAM indicates that this will be a TCP connection client.
We then connect the client to the server and send it some data The last step is to receive some data back and print out the reply or response from the server 
This is the simplest form of a TCP client connection
